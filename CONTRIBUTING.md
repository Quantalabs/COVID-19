# Contribution

# Issues

For any issue you're publishing, try to label them. Other than that, make sure you describe it well (show it if you can) and that's about it!

# Code

If editing pre-existing code, make sure it works (as I don't want people having there code changed to another version which *doesn't* work) and *if* it's okay with the original author,
you can change the file. Otherwise, I can create it as a new file instead. 

 #### Sidenote: Make sure you create a pull request so I can see that you want to merge it (unless you don't want to merge it).
 
## Adding your own files

If you create a new file (again, make a pull request so I can see you want to merge it), I should be okay with it and merge it unless it doesn't work or I find something that 
is offensive in some way. Another possibility is that it doesn't allow me to merge it with you're code, in which case you've probably deleted a file and I can just tell
you to put the file back and the whole world will be happy again!
